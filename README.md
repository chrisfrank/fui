# React Panel Tree

## TODO
- Accept an array as max
  - with default breakpoints
  - with props.breakpoints
- Accept bg as a prop
- Accept color as a prop
- Write more examples:
  - Specifying props.ratio
  - Specifying props.max
  - Changing props.max via an array
  - changing color and bg

- experiment with doing all transition work in react-motion
